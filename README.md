# WpfIpconfig
Tool run a CMD loop with the command ipconfig /flushdns. Interval default is 300 seconds.
You only need the WpfIpconfig.exe. Its the same like in ..\WpfIpconfig\bin\Debug\
The .zip you can download and read. Nothing evil inside.
One day i read the manual from Github, really cool possibilities.
